        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 red chilies, sliced (adjust according to your spice preference</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sweet soy sauce (also known as kecap manis)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tamarind paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon palm sugar or brown sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped scallions and sliced red chilies for garnish (optional)</li>
     </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Prepare the tempeh: Slice the tempeh into thin strips or small cubes. If the tempeh is too hard, you can steam it for 10 minutes before slicing to soften it slightly.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: In a small bowl, mix the sweet soy sauce, soy sauce, tamarind paste, palm sugar, and water. Stir until the sugar and tamarind paste dissolve. Adjust the sweetness and sourness according to your taste preferences.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil: In a large skillet or wok, heat the cooking oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Sauté the aromatics: Add the minced garlic, chopped onion, and sliced red chilies to the hot oil. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent and the mixture becomes fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the tempeh: Add the sliced tempeh to the skillet and stir-fry for about 5 minutes until the tempeh is lightly browned and slightly crispy on the edges.</li>
        <li>Pour in the sauce: Pour the sauce mixture over the tempeh, stirring to coat the tempeh evenly.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low and let the tempeh simmer in the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and coats the tempeh pieces nicely. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust: Taste the Tempeh Orek and add salt if needed. You can also adjust the sweetness, spiciness, or tanginess at this stage by adding more sweet soy sauce, chilies, or tamarind paste.</li>
        <Li>Garnish and serve: Once the tempeh is cooked and the sauce has thickened, turn off the heat. You can garnish with chopped scallions and sliced red chilies for added color and flavor. Serve the Tempeh Orek hot with steamed rice.</Li>
