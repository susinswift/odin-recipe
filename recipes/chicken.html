    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 chicken thighs, bone in or out, with or without skin</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, to season</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (or chicken broth)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white vinegar)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan or skillet over medium high heat; sear chicken thigh fillets or breast fillets on both sides until golden and cooked through.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>For bone in thighs:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Reduce heat after searing on both sides, cover skillet with a lid and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, while turning every 5 minutes until done. Alternatively, see notes for oven method.</li>
        <li>Drain most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons of pan juiced for added flavour.
        </li>

    </ol>
    <h5>For sauce:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>When chicken is done and cooked through, arrange chicken skin-side up in the pan (if cooking with skin); add the garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water, vinegar and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thicken slightly (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.
        </li>
    </ol>
